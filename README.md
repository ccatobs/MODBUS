# A Universal MODBUS Client

## READER

A universal MODBUS interface, where the mapping of variables to coil,
discrete input, input registers, and holding registers is entirely defined
by a JSON file, 
with no modification to the coding required whatsoever. The JSON file
comprises dictionaries representing single or multiple MODBUS registers or 
to bytes of it. Each dictionary comprises additional features, such as 

1) "parameter" - variable name unique over all registers (mandatory)
2) "function" - data type for input and holding registers (mandatory)
3) "description" (optional)
4) "map" - see below (optional)
5) "isTag" - true (optional), otherwise false in output
6) "muliplier" - for input & holding registers of datatype integer (optional)
7) "offset" for input & holding registers of datatype integer (optional)

The latter two will not be passed on to the output, though. They are parsed, 
such that the register's value is multiplied by the value of "multiplier" 
and an added to the value of "offset" (applies reversely for the writer). 
This is applicable to int and long data types.

A map is provided in case a value needs to match 
an entry from a provided list. The corresponding field value is passed on to 
the output as description superseding the input "description". If a map is 
defined, the description is chosen according to round(value). 
A map might also 
contain entries matching bits of the leading or trailing byte of a register.

Furthermore, "value" and "datatype" (AVRO conventions) are
reserved keywords, since they will be generated in the output dictionary.
Additional dictionary key/value pairs may be provided in the client registry
mapping, which are merely passed on to the output. To maintain consistancy over
the various modbus clients, we urge selecting same feature names for further
optional keys, such as "defaultvalue", "unit", "min", or "max".

Register keys are in the following formates: 
e.g. "30011" addressing the 12th register
of the input register class, "30011/1" or "30011/2" for
the leading and trailing byte of the 16 bit register, respectively.
Furthermore, "30011/30012" or "30011/30014" address 32 or 64 bit 
broad registers starting at the 12th register,
if registers are in zeroMode = True at the server's configuration.
A start/end register is to be provided for strings only, whereas the 
specification of an end register is not required for other data types.

A function needs to be defined for input and holding registers that translates
the 8, 16, 32, or 64 bits into appropriate values. This function is in the form,
e.g. "decode_32bit_uint" (see below for a selection):

| Function                                     | Value              | Avro Data Type |
|----------------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------|
| 8 bits of 1<sup>st</sup>/2<sup>nd</sup> byte | decode_bits        | boolean        |
| string of variable length                    | decode_string      | string         | 
| 8 int of 1<sup>st</sup>/2<sup>nd</sup> byte  | decode_8bit_int    | int            |
| 8 uint of 1<sup>st</sup>/2<sup>nd</sup> byte | decode_8bit_uint   | int            |
| 16 int                                       | decode_16bit_int   | int            |
| 16 uint                                      | decode_16bit_uint  | int            |
| 32 int                                       | decode_32bit_int   | int            |
| 32 uint                                      | decode_32bit_uint  | int            |
| 16 float                                     | decode_16bit_float | float          |
| 32 float                                     | decode_32bit_float | float          |
| 64 int                                       | decode_64bit_int   | long           |
| 64 uint                                      | decode_64bit_uint  | long           | 
| 64 float                                     | decode_64bit_float | double         |

Gaps between registers are permitted. A check on the uniqueness of "parameter" is 
performed as well as validity checks on the JSON keys.

The JSON file for the client configuration and mapping of registers to parameters
is defined as follows. 

```JSON

```
Note: "endianness" is optional, default is 
```JSON
{
    "byteorder": "<",
    "wordorder": ">"
}
```
Before decoding the modbus payloads, please consider that there is some 
confusion about Little-Endian vs. Big-Endian Word Order. The current modbus 
client allows the endiannesses of the byteorder (the Byte order of each word)
and the wordorder (the endianess of the word, when wordcount is >= 2) to be 
adjusted (see
[Parameters](https://github.com/ccatp/MODBUS/blob/625c77910993694c4dbdb4cad42c152e099af639/DeviceClassConfigs/mb_client_config_default.json)):

    ">" = Endian.Big 
    "<" = Endian.Little

Packing/unpacking depends on your CPU's word/byte order. MODBUS messages
are always using big endian. BinaryPayloadBuilder will per default use
what your CPU uses. The wordorder is applicable only for 32 and 64 bit values.
Let's say we need to write a value 0x12345678 to a 32 bit register.
The following combinations could be used to write the register 
[see also here](https://github.com/pymodbus-dev/pymodbus/blob/217469a234bc023a660acb9c448900288131022b/examples/client_payload.py). 

| Word Order | Byte order | Word1  | Word2  |
|------------|------------|--------|--------|
| Big        |     Big    | 0x1234 | 0x5678 |
| Big        |    Little  | 0x3412 | 0x7856 |
| Little     |     Big    | 0x5678 | 0x1234 |
| Little     |    Little  | 0x7856 | 0x3412 |

One note aside on bit maps to be read out of a register's 1<sup>st</sup> and/or 
2<sup>nd</sup> byte. Suppose a server's 16-bit register contains following 
hex value. The bit map
of a virtual parameter *TEST0* would look like:

```
         byte/1  byte/2
0x89AB = 1000100110101011
         h      lh      l
```

where l and h are the low and high bit of the byte, respectively. See also below,
when writing to registers with bit maps.
The byte order endianness on the client site
will absolutely not change the order of bits, 
whatsoever, if the *decode_bits* function is applied. What a relief!

Not implemented to date:
* decoder.bit_chunks() - coils

The result provided 
for the housekeeping (Kafka producer) is a list of dictionary objects.

Current MODBUS client version deployes the syncronous ModbusTcpClient 
version v3.4.0 (as of 2023/07/25). Consider it as beta version to be tested

Run (for testing):
    
    python3 mb_client_reader_v2.py --ip <device ip address> \
                                   [--port <device port> (default: 502)] \
                                   [--debug]


## WRITER

Only the register classes coil (class 0) and holding registers (class 4)
are eligible for writing. Registers in those classes may be 
changed by utilizing the writer method of MODBUSClient class.

Run (for testing):
    
    python3 mb_client_writer_v2.py --ip <device ip address> \
                                   [--port <device port> (default: 502)] \
                                   [--debug] \
                                   --payload "{\"test 32 bit int\": 720.04, ...}"

It accepts - as input - a JSON with one or multiple
{"parameter": "value"} pairs, where parameter needs to match (required!)
its counterpart in the Reader JSON as already defined above.

Note: parameters defined for MODBUS register classes 1 and 3 will be ignored.

Caveat: 

* Owing to Python's pymodbus module, registers can solely be updated on the
whole, which particularly applies for strings, bits and 8 bit-integers 
of the leading and trailing bytes.
* No locking mechanism is applied for parallel reading and writing, except for 
the MODBUS Web API.
* When updating bit maps for a 16-bit register, say *TEST0*, 
note that the 
payload needs to be formatted as of below. If less than 16 bits are provided, 
it will populate the register starting at the low bit of byte/1, subsequent
will be set to false.

```
                        byte/1          byte/2
--payload "{\"TEST0\": [1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1]}"
                        l             h l             h
```

## MODBUS Web API

Run the Rest API comprising 
the previously described MODBUS READER and WRITER methods
of the *MODBUSClient* class. An internal 
locking mechanism prevents reading and writing to the same device simulaneously.

The JSON config file comprises 
{"parameter": "value"} pairs that can be read and updated on the modbus device,
where &lt;device&gt; denotes the extention for each modbus device class 
(to be updated):

| Extension | MODBUS Device Class               |
|-----------|-----------------------------------|
| default   | simulator                         |
| test      | testing reader & writer integrity |
| lhx       | Rack                              |
| Cryomech  | Cryocooler                        |

The appropriate config file for the device class 
is sought in modbusClient/configFiles directory.

To enroll a new modbus device class, just provide the 
config file mb_client_config_&lt;device&gt;.json to the DeviceClassConfigs 
directory. It will be copied appropriately with the Docker container setup.

Run the RestAPI for testing:

    python3 mb_client_RestAPI.py --host <host> (default: 127.0.0.1) \
                                 --port <port> (default: 5100)

Get the read and write endpoints, by typing in the browser URL:

    <host>:<port>/docs#

![](https://github.com/ccatp/MODBUS/blob/a3cb28bf0e3df9b4a7fdd6e8e113a9134b3acd47/pics/API_swagger_MODBUS.png)

Alternatively, invoke cli *curl* for the Reader:

    curl <host><port>:/modbus/read/<device_ip> 

and for the Writer:

    curl <host>:<port>/modbus/write/<device_ip> -X PUT \
            -d 'payload={"test 32 bit int": 720.04, 
            "write int register": 10, 
            "string of register/1": "YZ", 
            "Coil 0": true, 
            "Coil 1": true, 
            "Coil 10": true}'

Caveat: 

Whilst environmental parameters are set in the Docker container, they have 
to be defined separately in the 
OS environment, in which *mb_client_RestAPI.py* runs, ita est:

*ServerPort=&lt;MODBUS Server Port&gt;*,

*ServerIPS=&lt;MODBUS Server IP[, ...]&gt;*, and

*Debug=True/False*

#### Processing Times

As a note aside, the processing time of the MODBUS reader is quite slow, though. 
For example, the time to read out all registers from the server simulator, 
as defined in 
[test config](https://github.com/ccatp/MODBUS/blob/625c77910993694c4dbdb4cad42c152e099af639/DeviceClassConfigs/mb_client_config_test.json),
is roughly 100 ms.
